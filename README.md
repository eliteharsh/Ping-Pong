# Ping-Pong
Play, compete, and challenge the AI in a sleek, minimalistic Pong experience


Pong Game is a modern, browser-based remake of the classic arcade game. It features smooth paddle controls, an AI opponent with adjustable difficulty, real-time score tracking, interactive sound effects, and a clean, minimalistic UI. Built entirely with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, it demonstrates fundamental front-end skills such as canvas rendering, animation, event handling, and simple game physics, making it a great showcase for interactive web development projects.
